This module alters the Drupal page flow so that users (regardless of login state)
will ALWAYS recieve the anonymous-cached version of the page.

Once loaded, an AJAX request is sent off for an uncached version of the page which
is then shown to the user to allow all customised content to be available.

This follows the same principles as ESI without the one-request-per-block issue
that it creates.

This is a trade-off between "initial speed" and "page displaying corretly always"
